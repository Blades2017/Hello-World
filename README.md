# Hello-World
My first repository
I am a student in the feild of comptuer networking and system administration. I have a strong urge to make coding a hobby of mine. I have done some in the past and even made a simple game or two using python and gamemaker. I want something to sink my time into that can create awesome things, thus I want to learn to code.
